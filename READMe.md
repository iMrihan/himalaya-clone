# himalaya-clone
This is the first ever individual project built by me  during construct week at  Masai School. The tech stack used for this project is HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and Local Storage.
# HOW DID I BUILD THE HIMALAYAS CLONE WEBSITE BY ITS SELF?
I would like to express how grateful I am to Masai School for giving me this wonderful opportunity to learn under their guidance and for sharing my first project experience which I had done remotely.


# Introduction
My task was to implement our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge which we had learned at Masai. I used this skill set to build a static copy of himalaya.com.
# How I started the project
I started this project with just a few simple questions like what I can do in this project and in this short span of time how much I can deliver, what major points I should consider, and how to implement communication while working remotely. I was able to identify all the problems one shall face while building the project and had necessary guidelines in place which would help me move forward step by step rather than jumping and opening many things at a time.
The platform used for communication
Delivering a result-oriented output of any work/project communication between the Masai IA is the most crucial part. I used slack and zoom to communicate with them. The effective and goal-oriented approach towards communication made this task a lot easier for me.
# Challenges
Git-pull and push of the code.
Merging code for the first time.
Adding javascript for functionalities.
# Takeaways
To be able to work on a project must possess leadership qualities
Overall, it was a surreal experience, and I look forward to many such challenges.
